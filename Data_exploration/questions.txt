1. What is the most common weather description in New York City?
- Finding the weather condition that occurs most frequently in the dataset for New York City.

2. What is the correlation between temperature and humidity?
- Finding if there’s a statistical relationship between temperature and humidity. 
- Plot the correlation matrix seems like a good option

3. How does the ‘feels like’ temperature vary from the actual temperature?
- Understand the difference between the actual temperature and the ‘feels like’ temperature.
- Plot correlation matrix or parallel bar chart might be good

4. How does visibility change with different weather conditions?
- This question aims to understand how visibility varies under different weather conditions,
this might include Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Weather Description, Wind Speed and even Wind Degree.
- Plot a correlation matrix might be good

5. What is the variability of atmospheric pressure over a certain period?
- This question seeks to understand the changes in atmospheric pressure over a specific time period.
- Simple bar/line chart showcasing the value of atmospheric pressure in each specific timestamp?

6. How often does the weather description indicate clear skies in each recorded location? 
- For each location in the dataset, calculate the frequency of which the skies are clear
- Simple line chart should be sufficient in showing the frequency for each location

7. How does the minimum and maximum temperature vary throughout the year? 
- Understand the variation in minimum and maximum temperatures over the course of a year.
- Might also help understand the climate change as a whole
- A possible approach is to calculate the difference between the minimum and the maximum and plot that difference on a line chart 

8. What weather conditions are most likely to occur when the temperature is low?
- When the temperature is low (below a certain threshold), analyze the trend in the current value for other attributes
